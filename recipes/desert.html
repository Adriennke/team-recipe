        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups original unsweetened Almond Milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp white or apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce*</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 heaping cups whole-wheat pastry flour or unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups organic cane sugar (or sub granulated sugar)</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly spray 2 8-inch <br> round cake pans or 1 large
                rectangular
                pan
                with nonstick spray (see notes for cooking times for different <br>size pans // adjust number or size of
                pans if
                altering batch size). Dust with cocoa powder, shake out the excess and set aside.</li>
            <li> Mix the almond milk and vinegar in a large mixing bowl,<br> and let set for a few minutes to activate.
                Add
                the
                oil, coffee, vanilla extract, and applesauce and beat until foamy.<br> If coconut oil hardens, microwave
                the
                mixture in 10-15 second increments until melted.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, <br>baking powder,and salt to a sifter and slowly sift
                over
                the wet ingredients while mixing with a hand-held or standing mixer.<br> If you don’t have a sifter,
                simply
                mix
                dry ingredients in another bowl and add to the wet mixture<br> while beating. Beat until no large lumps
                remain.
                It should be creamy and pourable. <br>Taste and adjust sweetness as needed,<br> adding more sugar if
                desired
                (I
                found it plenty sweet).</li>
            <li> Divide batter evenly between your cake pans or rectangular pan.</li>
            <li> Bake 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted <br>into the center comes out clean. Let cool
                completely
                before frosting.</li>
            <li> While cooling, prepare frosting by beating <br>together all ingredients until light and fluffy,
                adding the
                powdered sugar in small amounts until you reach <br>your desired consistency and sweetness. <br>If it
                becomes too
                thick, add more almond milk. If it’s too thin, add more <br>cocoa powder or powdered sugar.
                Once the cake is cooled, frost generously with buttercream <br>frosting, adding a thick layer
                between the top
                and bottom layers (if doing a 2-layer cake). Alternatively,<br> omit the frosting and dust with
                cocoa powder.
                Serve with a scoop of dairy-free ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate,<br> or caramel sauce, coconut
                whipped cream
                or a glass of almond milk!</li>
