        <h1>Vegan Chocolate Cake</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups original unsweetened Almond Milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp white or apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce*</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 heaping cups whole-wheat pastry flour or unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups organic cane sugar (or sub granulated sugar)</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly spray 2 8-inch round cake pans or 1 large rectangular
                pan
                with nonstick spray (see notes for cooking times for different size pans // adjust number or size of
                pans if
                altering batch size). Dust with cocoa powder, shake out the excess and set aside.</li>
            <li> Mix the almond milk and vinegar in a large mixing bowl, and let set for a few minutes to activate. Add
                the
                oil, coffee, vanilla extract, and applesauce and beat until foamy. If coconut oil hardens, microwave the
                mixture in 10-15 second increments until melted.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a sifter and slowly sift
                over
                the wet ingredients while mixing with a hand-held or standing mixer. If you don’t have a sifter, simply
                mix
                dry ingredients in another bowl and add to the wet mixture while beating. Beat until no large lumps
                remain.
                It should be creamy and pourable. Taste and adjust sweetness as needed, adding more sugar if desired (I
                found it plenty sweet).</li>
            <li> Divide batter evenly between your cake pans or rectangular pan.</li>
            <li> Bake 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool
                completely
                before frosting.</li>
            <li> While cooling, prepare frosting by beating together all ingredients until light and fluffy,
                adding the
                powdered sugar in small amounts until you reach your desired consistency and sweetness. If it
                becomes too
                thick, add more almond milk. If it’s too thin, add more cocoa powder or powdered sugar.
                Once the cake is cooled, frost generously with buttercream frosting, adding a thick layer
                between the top
                and bottom layers (if doing a 2-layer cake). Alternatively, omit the frosting and dust with
                cocoa powder.
                Serve with a scoop of dairy-free ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate, or caramel sauce, coconut
                whipped cream
                or a glass of almond milk!</li>
